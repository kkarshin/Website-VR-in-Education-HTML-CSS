<p> 
Virtual Reality is used in education to enhance student's engagement with their study. Immersive learning enhances the learning process by allowing students to interact and engage in experimentation. This helps to fulfil the curiosity of young learners, and they can progress at their own pace as VR contains the ability for students to connect key concepts multiple times.

<p> 
In addition, the presence of VR improves learning outcomes. Students can experience and visualize the scenario in a virtual environment which provides students the opportunity to learn abstract concepts. In contrast to traditional learning processes, which are often language-based and conceptual, VR learning environment promotes active learning and helps students master knowledge.

Furthermore, Virtual Reality (VR) also promotes communication and collaboration skills. Students can learn together in a virtual environment without the limits of physical location. Group projects and interactive discussions can be done through VR to ensure that all the work can be done effectively in a specific time. The use of VR also fosters teamwork and communication skills.

VR technology allows learners to replace their real environments in a virtual environment. VR is well-suited for any education centre that is seeking learning experiences for students but is unable to venture out into the field. On the other hand, VR gives great support for students with learning disabilities or physical limitations. VR acts as a tool to provide alternative learning opportunities to ensure a more inclusive educational environment.
