Virtual Reality (VR) in education enhances learning by providing immersive experiences such as virtual field trips, interactive science experiments, and medical simulations.While VR increases engagement and understanding, it can also reduce interaction and collaboration in traditional classrooms. Case studies help to assess its effectiveness, challenges, and balance with traditional teaching methods.

<p> 
In the case study of Virtual Reality Field Trips. A school in the United States used the Google Expeditions platform to take students on a virtual field trip to Ancient Rome, where students could explore the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and other historical sites to deepen their understanding of history and culture as well as historical architecture, and the immersion of virtual reality also increased student engagement and brought history to life.

<b> <h2> Virtual Reality in UCLA Surgical Training Study </h2> </b>
</li>
<br>

<p>
UCLA conducted a study on the use of virtual reality on the skeleton with 20 people and divided into 2 groups, VR and traditional, and through the tests it was found that the VR group performed better than the traditional group and was 20% faster than the traditional group, suggesting that there are now several virtual reality surgical simulators that have been developed that can provide relevant skeletal tissue information and detailed information about tools, allowing students and trainees to learn what they need to know faster and in more detail.

<b> <h2> Virtual Reality in River City Project </h2> </b>
</li>
<p>
Immersive virtual environments are particularly useful for training students in clinical skills and communication where the River City project was enabled which was a simulation of a city plagued by health problems, students were divided into groups to find out the causes of the city's illnesses, using the technology of the virtual environments to look for clues, students to analyze the sources and causes of the illnesses, and students to analyse the causes of the illnesses, using the technology of the virtual environments to find clues

<b> <h2> Virtual Reality in Language Learning </h2> </b>
</li>
<br>
<img src="VR article3.jpg">
<p>
The use of VRchat, a virtual reality platform for learning, to improve students' English listening skills, this study faced 40 undergraduates, from different majors but all of them are taking English courses at the university, and this study used the TOEIC to test the English language proficiency, and after the experimental study the students got significant results. After the experimental study, the students made a significant improvement. This also proves that virtual reality is good for students to learn and is more effective than traditional textbook lectures.
