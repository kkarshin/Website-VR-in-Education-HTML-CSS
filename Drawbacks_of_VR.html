Myopia is a common visual impairment in modern society. The incidence of myopia is increasing with the development of the global economy and society. Virtual Reality is closer to the user's eyes than the phones or computers we use in our lives, so it can affect the tear film and ocular surface. Children and teenagers are at a critical stage of development, and users may experience neurological symptoms such as headaches, dizziness and nausea after using Virtual Reality, which is more serious than using a computer or mobile phone. Even though the use of Virtual Reality in school teaching can increase interest in the classroom, it can do more harm than good to young people's eyesight and even bring health and safety issues. Long-term use of Virtual Reality in the classroom may lead to physical discomfort of students, these include eye fatigue and loss of direction, and even some students have symptoms such as nausea and dizziness because of the immersive experience of Virtual Reality, which will impress the effect of learning.

High-quality Virtual Reality headsets tend to be expensive, which is a considerable expense for schools or students’ families with limited budgets. Subsequent consideration should also be given to the ongoing costs of Virtual Reality equipment, maintenance upgrades and content updates. In addition to the cost of money, the cost of time is also one of the issues to consider. Teachers and students need to spend extra time learning how to use the Virtual Reality headsets they have. Learning how to teach and explore a virtual world requires teachers to spend more time incorporating course content into their teaching plans. They also need to teach students how to use Virtual Reality devices, which is undoubtedly a challenge for some older teachers. Virtual Reality devices are like any computer. As more and more students and teachers use them, the probability of failure will increase with an increase in usage time. Therefore, teachers need to prepare other solutions to deal with sudden Virtual Reality failures and crashes.

</li>
<p>
The use of Virtual Reality in the classroom may cause students to reduce face-to-face interaction with each other, which is not helpful for students who are going to enter university in the future. Because it may affect the communication ability between students or between students and teachers or the teamwork ability between students. The immersive experience brought by long-term exposure to Virtual Reality may isolate students in the real world and reduce their interaction with people around them.
